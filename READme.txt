There are three codes in this folder
1. subandrepeat.c
    This above code demonstrates the implementation of suffix tree using ukkonen algorithm and its first two applications.
    A.)To find if a substring is present in a text
    B.)To find the longest repeated substring in a test
2. longestcommon.c
    In this code we have used suffix tree to achieve the goal of finding longest common substring between two strings.
3  palindrome.cpp
    This code demonstrates another application of suffix tree to find longest palindromic substring of a text.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
SOME NOTES:-
1.) Code 1 and 2 are our main project files that we implemented in C.

2.) Code 3 is just an extra application of suffix tree that we implemented and since unordered_set data structure needs to be used to maintain the O(N) complexity , so it is implemented in c++.
    other than use of undordered_set all implementation is done as C language in this code("palindrome.cpp")
